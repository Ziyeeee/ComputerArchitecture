This directory contains the files you will need for Performance Lab.

kernels.c
	This is the file you will be modifying and handing in. 

#########################################
# You shouldn't modify any of these files
#########################################
driver.c
	This is the driver that tests the performance of all 
	of the versions of the rotate and smooth kernels 
	in your kernels.c file.

config.h
	This is a site-specific configuration file that was created by 
	your instructor	for your system

defs.h
	Various definitions needed by kernels.c and driver.c

clock.{c,h}
fcyc.{c,h}
	These contain timing routines that measure the performance of your
	code with our k-best measurement scheme using IA32 cycle counters.

Makefile:
	This is the makefile that builds the driver program.

################
Usage of Driver
################
The source code you will write will be linked with object code that we supply into a driver binary. To create this binary, you will need to execute the command
linux > make driver

You will need to re-make driver each time you change the code in kernels.c. To test your implementations, you can then run the command:
linux > ./driver

The driver can be run in four different mode:
  - Default mode, in which all versions of your implementations are run.
  - Autograder mode, in which only the rotate() and smooth() functions are run. 
  - File mode, in which only versions that are mentioned in an input file are run
  - Dump mode, in which a one-line descrition of each version is dumped to a text file. You can then edit this text
    file to keep only those versions that you'd like to test using the file mode. You can specify wheter to quit after dumping the 
    file or if your implemtations are to be run.

If run without any arguments, driver will run all of your versions (default mode). Other modes and options can be specified by command-line aruguments to driver, as listed below:
  -g :Run only rotate() and smooth() functions (autograder mode).
  -f <funcfile> : Execute only those versions specified in <funcfile> (file mode).
  -d <dumpfile> : Dump the names of all versions to a dump file called <dumpfile>, one line to a version (dump mode).
  -q : Quit after dumping version names to a dump file. To be used in tandem with -d. For example, to quit immediately after printing the dump file, type ./driver -qd dumpfile.
  -h: Print the command line usage.
